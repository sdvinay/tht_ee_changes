This directory contains all of our modifications and customizations to
the Expression Engine code.  Under this main EE_changes directory is a
directory for each version of EE that we've installed.  In each of
those directories are our modified versions of files from those
versions.  Each modification should be thoroughly commented, so that
at any time we can easily (a) find changes, (b) know exactly what was
changed, and (c) know exactly why we made a change.

To upgrade to a new version of EE:
-- Upload the new EE code to our account
-- Create a new directory under EE_changes for the new version
-- For each file in the current version of EE_changes, propagate the
changes forward into the new EE_changes directory
-- Install/upgrade EE, following the EE upgrade instructions
-- Copy the latest EE_changes files to their proper locations.
